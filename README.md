# zuckblog-bootstrap
My personal technology blogs build by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which is an open source program, and [Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) which is popular front-end framework.  

The blog files are at [gh-pages](https://github.com/amazingmanthere/zuckblog-bootstrap/tree/gh-pages) branch.
